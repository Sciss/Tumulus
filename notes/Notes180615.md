# Wifi

Listing the visible networks:

    sudo iwlist wlan0 scan

Alternative:

    sudo iw dev wlan0 scan
    
On desktop, `iwlist` works, but interface is `wlp1s0`.
With `iw dev`, we get sections beginning with `"BSS <mac-address>(on <adapter>)..."`, followed
by YAML-style tab indented key-value meta data. We should look for

        SSID: <the name>
        
and

        signal: <strength> dBm
        
where -46.00 dBm is very strong (4), for example, -56.00 dBm is strong (3), -73.00 dBm is weak, 
-78.00 dBm and -85.00 dBm are very weak (1). Let's say up to -48 dB is very strong, up to -60 dB is strong,
up to -76 dB is weak, below is very weak. (whatever)

Getting currently connected network:

    iwgetid
    iwgetid --raw   # just print the ESSID

Use 'sudo' to also work on desktop. See stored networks

    sudo cat /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Forgetting networks:

- remove from `wpa_supplicant.conf`
- run `wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure`
- run `sudo iw dev wlan0 disconnect`

Check: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md

The "empty" file `wpa_supplicant.conf` is

    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1
    country=MX

For each network:

    network={
        ssid="..."
        psk="..."
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    }

This entry can be generated via

    wpa_passphrase "testing" < file_where_password_is_stored
    
The output will be 

    network={
        ssid="name"
        #psk="plain-test"
        psk=blablabla
    }

One should remove the commented out plain text password.
If this is appended to `wpa_supplicant.conf`, we can make the system try reconnect by

- run `wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure`
- run `sudo iw dev wlan0 connect "ssid-name"`

## Ping

    ping -c 1 -I wlp1s0 ssh.strato.de

Note that `-W 10` has no effect if DNS does not work, because DNS resolution is not covered, but its
own deadline is given in `/etc/resolv.conf`.

```scala
import sys.process._
val code1: Int = Seq("ping", "-c", "1", "-I", "wlp1s0", "ssh.strato.deX").!  // code 2 if not found
val code2: Int = Seq("ping", "-c", "1", "-I", "wlp1s0", "ssh.strato.de").!  // code 0 if found
```

To check if DNS is the issue, try with resolved IP (`81.169.145.126`).

# Camera settings

    raspistill -o Pictures/test2.jpg -t 1 -q 100 -awb off -drc off -ISO 400 -awbg 1.5,1,1.2 -ss 2000 --rotation 180

# Touch Screen

    $ cat /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf 
    Section "InputClass"
        Identifier	"calibration"
        MatchProduct	"ADS7846 Touchscreen"
        Option	"Calibration"	"210 3900 3900 200"
        Option	"SwapAxes"	"1"
        Option	"TransformationMatrix"	"0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1"
    EndSection
    
After system updates, this crucial installation step has to be repeated, otherwise the monitor goes
back to HDMI:

    $ sudo vi /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbturbo.conf

And change the line...

    Option
    "fbdev" "/dev/fb0"

to 

    "fbdev" "/dev/fb1

# User Interface

Touch screen resolution is 320x480 pixels.

Items in top level:

- 'Configure Wifi': to do the above (list networks, options to forget and add wireless networks)
- 'Test network': check whether we can copy the data to our server
- 'Update software': this could try to locate latest release on GitHub, download the .deb, etc.
- 'Record data': go to audio/photo preview
- 'Shutdown', 'Reboot', 'Terminal'

--------------

# Updates

Git latest download links from GitHub:

    curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Sciss/Tumulus/releases/latest

Check package version

    dpkg-deb -f my-package.deb version

--------------

# Transfers

Check for truncated (aborted or ongoing) FTP upload/download

```scala
import sys.process._
val codeOk : Int = Seq("flac", "-t", "/data/temp/rec180817_161843.flac"     ).! // 0
val codeBad: Int = Seq("flac", "-t", "/data/temp/rec180817_161843_CROP.flac").! // 1
```

# Checklist

To send:

- pi in case, power adaptor with mexican 'type A' power plug
- tripod for pi
- touch pen
- microphone with wind screen and clamp (in transport case)
- tripod for mic with adaptor screw for clamp
- XLR cable red
- UMC22 with dark blue USB cable
- white sheet for calibration
- headphones adaptor?
- SD card backup (cf. https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone)
- ethernet cable?

To implement:

- set correct pi time zone
- WB "too bright" does not work
- allow software update from USB stick
- work-around for wifi trouble with missing gateway:
  page for manual IP / gateway, change sftp host (so we can avoid DNS);
  possibly option to upload to USB instead
