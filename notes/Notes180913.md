# Sound Procedure

- `baseDir`: `~/Documents/projects/Tumulus/` or `/data/projects/Tumulus`
- `downloadDir` = `baseDir / "downloads"`

## Initial scan

- we wipe `downloadDir`

- We run `SFTP.list` to determine the non-empty `.properties` files, along with `.jpg` and `.flac` 
  (filter only for complete entries).

- We start a download process (async) to `downloadDir`.

- For a complete entry, we pass it to a second process `render`

## Modules

So we have three actors: download management, render management, playback.
It's easier to combine download and rendering.

### Download and Rendering

- wipe temp (or at least constrain size); as only files are here which have not been removed from the server
- list candidates (all three files there, non-empty)
- iterate list
   - download triplet
   - upon completion, delete triplet on server
   - render data
   - upon completion, delete download copies
   - make this, so we can cancel process before going to hibernation
   
Because file names carry correct date and time stamp, we can sort them and keep only the N most recent ones
(we could move the old ones to a storage dir if we want to keep them for documentation purposes)
